ES6 Learning Project

Welcome to the ES6 Learning Project! This README will guide you through the objectives and requirements for this project. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain various ES6 features and concepts clearly.

#Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

1. What ES6 is:

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. It introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript.
New features introduced in ES6:

Key features include block-scoped variables (let and const), arrow functions, template literals, destructuring assignments, default parameters, rest and spread operators, and more.
The difference between a constant and a variable:

#Constants (const) cannot be reassigned once declared, while variables (let and var) can be reassigned.
Block-scoped variables:

#Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in.
Arrow functions and function parameters default to them:

#Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and do not have their own this context. They can also have default parameters.
Rest and spread function parameters:

#The rest operator (...) allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The spread operator (...) allows an iterable to be expanded into individual elements.
String templating in ES6:

#Template literals use backticks () and allow for embedded expressions using ${expression}` syntax.
Object creation and their properties in ES6:

ES6 introduced shorthand property names, computed property names, and method definitions for objects.
Iterators and for-of loops:

Iterators provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially. The for-of loop iterates over iterable objects, such as arrays, strings, and more.
