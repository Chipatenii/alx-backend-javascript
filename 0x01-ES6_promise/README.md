# JavaScript Promises and Async/Await

Welcome to the JavaScript Promises and Async/Await project! This README will guide you through the learning objectives and requirements for this project. By the end of this project, you should have a comprehensive understanding of Promises and the async/await syntax in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. **Promises (how, why, and what)**
   - Understand what Promises are in JavaScript and how they work.
   - Learn why Promises are used and the problems they solve.
   - Gain knowledge on how to create and use Promises effectively.

2. **How to use the then, resolve, catch methods**
   - Learn how to chain Promises using the `then` method.
   - Understand how to handle successful Promise resolutions using `resolve`.
   - Know how to handle errors in Promises using the `catch` method.

3. **How to use every method of the Promise object**
   - Explore all methods provided by the Promise object, such as `all`, `race`, `allSettled`, and `any`.
   - Learn how to apply these methods in practical scenarios.

4. **Throw / Try**
   - Understand how to use the `throw` statement to generate custom errors.
   - Learn how to handle exceptions using `try` and `catch` blocks.

5. **The await operator**
   - Gain knowledge on how the `await` operator works in JavaScript.
   - Learn how to use `await` to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved.

6. **How to use an async function**
   - Understand the syntax and structure of async functions.
   - Learn how to define and use async functions to handle asynchronous operations more effectively.
