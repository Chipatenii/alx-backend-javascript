# JavaScript Classes and Metaprogramming

Welcome to the JavaScript Classes and Metaprogramming project! This README will guide you through the learning objectives for this project. By the end of this project, you should have a comprehensive understanding of how to define and use classes in JavaScript, as well as an introduction to metaprogramming.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

1. **How to define a Class**
   - Learn how to create and define a class in JavaScript using the `class` keyword.
   - Understand the syntax for class definitions, including constructors and properties.

2. **How to add methods to a class**
   - Discover how to add instance methods to a class.
   - Understand how these methods can be used to manipulate and interact with class instances.

3. **Why and how to add a static method to a class**
   - Understand the purpose of static methods and how they differ from instance methods.
   - Learn how to define static methods within a class using the `static` keyword.

4. **How to extend a class from another**
   - Explore how to create a subclass by extending an existing class using the `extends` keyword.
   - Understand inheritance and how subclasses can override or inherit properties and methods from their parent class.

5. **Metaprogramming and symbols**
   - Gain an introduction to metaprogramming in JavaScript.
   - Learn about symbols, a new primitive type introduced in ES6, and how they can be used for unique property keys and other advanced programming techniques.
